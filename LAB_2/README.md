For Lab 2, we had to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. 
The index.html will test my knowledge of HTML by using different kinds of tags and elements. 

The index_part2.html uses CSS with the class weird_list.css. 
I was able to style and structure the webpage with fonts and colors using basic CSS knowledge. 
There is also screenshots to prove my program functions.
